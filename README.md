# Reprentation_Thoery_Final_Project
In this repository, I will have my final project from my Representation Theory course instructed by Dr. Gizem Karaali. The Project is focused on understanding the components necessary for understanding Baginski and Gromadzki's On Symmetric Representations of Groups of Automorphisms on Bordered Klein surfaces.
